Notes about paper:

Tuning parameters:

SIFTflowparams.alpha=0.01;
SIFTflowparams.d=0.175; (tuned down - higher cross correlation)
SIFTflowparams.gamma=0.001;
SIFTflowparams.nlevels=6; (tuned up - better accuracy)
SIFTflowparams.wsize=3;
SIFTflowparams.topwsize=10; (changing does nothing really, makes worse if bigger)
SIFTflowparams.nIterations=60;

Sift figured out what the correlation coefficient method of fitting would not.
We can see that SIFTFlow aligned the images quite closely desptie the 
transformation tearing in the image. This method of image alignment is 
not sensitive to the lighting in the image as the intensity-based approach
would be; however, it reaps the benefits of the optical flow algorithm
that is intensity-based. Hence, this method is able to apply a fusion of
the geometric and intensity-based algorithms using SIFT flow descriptors
as the input to the optical flow algorithm. Based on the graphs, we can
gather that the SIFTFLow registration is invariant to lighting.

Tried to use complement of image to fix lighting match-up issues on error
image, but couldn't. Sift still worked the same despite these changes, 
hence the invariance to lighting or color. It is also invariant to rotation
as seen by the upside-down arrow in Figure 2. It was able to rotate the 
arrow to be upside like the template image.
